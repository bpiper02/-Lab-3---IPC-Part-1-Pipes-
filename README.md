In this lab, we explored the concept of inter-process communication (IPC) using pipes. We implemented programs where multiple processes communicate with each other by reading from and writing to pipes. The goal of this part of the lab was to understand how to chain processes together, pass data between them, and manage process synchronization. Screenshot below shows correct and desired output.
